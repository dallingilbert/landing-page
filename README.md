## What is this project?
A small project to demonstrate responsive web layouts and have some fun while doing it. I used this as a refresher for flexbox layouts as I already had a good amount of experience using javascript and css. While creating this page and following the odin project, I thought it would be cool to also talk a little about the rubber ducky method. I find that forcing myself to think out loud and to explain what is going on when facing a problem helps tremendously! This is the first little project that will be apart of a bigger portfolio. Thanks for stopping by :)
